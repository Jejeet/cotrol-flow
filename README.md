Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators

> Arithmetic Operators:

- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
- Modulo: %
- Exponentiation: **
- Increment: ++
- Decrement: --

> Assignment Operators:

- Assignment: =
- Addition assignment: +=
- Subtraction assignment: -=
- Multiplication assignment: *=
- Division assignment: /=
- Modulo assignment: %=
- Exponentiation assignment: **=
- Bitwise AND assignment: &=
- Bitwise OR assignment: |=
- Bitwise XOR assignment: ^=
- Left shift assignment: <<=
- Right shift assignment: >>=
- Unsigned right shift assignment: >>>=


> Comparison Operators:

- Equal to: ==
- Not equal to: !=
- Strict equal to: ===
- Strict not equal to: !==
- Greater than: >
- Less than: <
- Greater than or equal to: >=
- Less than or equal to: <=


> Logical Operators:

- Logical AND: &&
- Logical OR: ||
- Logical NOT: !

> Bitwise Operators:

- Bitwise AND: &
- Bitwise OR: |
- Bitwise XOR: ^
- Bitwise NOT: ~
- Left shift: <<
- Right shift: >>
- Unsigned right shift: >>>

2. For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.
> Arithmetic Operators:

- Addition:
 let sum = 5 + 7;
console.log(sum); // Output: 12
- Modulo: 
let remainder = 15 % 4;
console.log(remainder); // Output: 3
> Assignment Operators
- Assignment:
let y;
y = 5;
console.log(y); // Output: 5
- Addition assignment:
let x = 10;
x += 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 15

> Comparison Operators

- Equal to:

let x = 5;
let y = 5;
console.log(x == y); // Output: true

- Greater than:
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
console.log(x > y); // Output: true

> Logical Operators
- Logical AND:
 let x = 5;
let y = 10;
console.log(x < y && y < 20); // Output: true

- Logical OR:
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
console.log(x > y || y < 20); // Output: true

> Bitwise Operators
- Bitwise AND:
let x = 5 & 3;
console.log(x); // Output: 1

- Bitwise XOR:
let x = 5 ^ 3;
console.log(x); // Output: 6

4. for (let i=1; i < 20; i +=7){
    console.log(i);
} // result is:
1
8
15
